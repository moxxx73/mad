MADD - Multi-Architecture Disassembler/Debugger
------------------------------------------------
this project is very early in development and you may ask why am i doing it?
Because i read "Build your own fucking birdfeeder" from "POC||GTFO" and 
finally decided to finally persue building my own tools so yh. 
(also cannot recommend the book enough)

# Building

for now u can just build madd with:
  gcc mad.c util.c pool.c cli.c madELF.c cmds.c -Wall -Wextra -o ../mad

# Note

obviously i'll need to provide a Makefile in the future but im not well versed
in writing one so that'll be something else to do... i'll probably do that next

I'm also gonna rework the command line syntax to make it more efficient,
this will probably make it more reminiscent to something like radare2
as i believe running a "switch-case" against individual characters is more
efficient than running "if-else" against the result of different calls to strncmp()
