MAD - Multi-Architecture Disassembler/Debugger
------------------------------------------------
this project is very early in development and you may ask why am i doing it?
Because i read "Build your own fucking birdfeeder" from "POC||GTFO" and 
finally decided to finally persue building my own tools so yh. 
(also cannot recommend the book enough)

# Building

for now u can just build madd with:
  gcc mad.c util.c pool.c cli.c madELF.c cmds.c -Wall -Wextra -o ../mad

Most Recent Update
-------------------
+ Created Makefile
+ Changed CLI syntax to be more efficient

Next i will implement all features for the elf command (e[?]) and once this is
done work on disassembly will begin.
