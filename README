MAD - Multi-Architecture Disassembler/Debugger
------------------------------------------------
this project is very early in development and you may ask why am i doing it?
Because im building my own fucking birdfeeder

Need help using the tool? just use the "?" command for help and
yh its basically the radare2 syntax, the idea of if-else'ing
the return value of multiple calls to strncmp() just really irked me


Most Recent Update
-------------------
+ Created Makefile
+ Changed CLI syntax to be more efficient

Next i will implement all features for the elf command (e[?]) and once this is
done work on disassembly will begin.

Note
-----
who/what tf is cloning my shit dude? also im very tired so update work will
begin when i wakeup
