MADD - Multi-Architecture Disassembler/Debugger
------------------------------------------------
this project is very early in development and you may ask why am i doing it?
Because i read "Build your own fucking birdfeeder" from "POC||GTFO" and 
finally decided to finally persue building my own tools so yh. 
(also cannot recommend the book enough)

# Building

for now u can just build madd with:
  gcc mad.c util.c pool.c cli.c madELF.c cmds.c -Wall -Wextra -o ../mad
  
obviously i'll need to provide a Makefile in the future but im not well versed
in writing one so that'll be something else to do... i'll probably do that next
