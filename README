MADD - Multi-Architecture Disassembler/Debugger
------------------------------------------------
this project is very early in development and you may ask why am i doing it?
Because i read "Build your own fucking birdfeeder" from "POC||GTFO" and 
finally decided to finally persue building my own tools so yh. 
(also cannot recommend the book enough)
